# Not given parameters will receive default values

# GELS
# nb: Tile size
# ib: Inner tile size
# M: Number of rows of matrix A
# N: Number of columns of matrix B
# K: Number of columns of matrix A and rows of Matrix B
# LDA: Leading dimension of matrix A
# LDB: Leading dimension of matrix B
# trans: Wether the system involves A (ChamNoTrans) or A^H *ChamTransConj). Currently only ChamNoTrans is supported.
# qra: Size of TS domain
# qrp: Size of high level tree for distributed mode
# llvl: Tree used for low level reduction insides nodes
# hlv: Tree used for high level reduction between nodes, only if qrp > 1
# domino: Enable/Disable the domino between upper and lower trees
